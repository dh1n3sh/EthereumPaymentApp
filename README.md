# EthereumPaymentApp
You can view this dapp at https://dh1n3sh.github.io/EthereumPaymentApp/  
I have placed the code for the smart contract in [SmartContract](/SmartContract)  

  
### Steps to Connect with the Smart Contract
1. You need Metamask for the dapp to work. For more details view this article on getting the metamask extension [How to Install and Use Metamask](https://blog.wetrust.io/how-to-install-and-use-metamask-7210720ca047)  
2. The smart contract is deployed in the Ropsten Test Network. So in Metamask choose the Ropsten Test Network and get some ether for free by following this article [How to get Ropsten ETH](https://www.2key.network/blog-posts/what-is-ropsten-eth-and-how-can-i-get-some#:~:text=You%20can%20claim%20Ropsten%20ETH,%3A%2F%2Ffaucet.ropsten.be%2F).  
3. View the website and accept the confirmation message in metamask, when it pops up.  
4. If the balance is not shown, click reload. If the balance is not shown even after reloading, check if you have configured metamask properly.
